The home page has direct links to the paper and the preprint, so this page exists just to offer the same link after you've left the landing page.
I'd recommend to make sections for the different versions of the manuscript online. Obviously, there are the final paper and the preprint, but perhaps you've also pre-registered your study, in which case you could link it here too to collect all versions and stages of the manuscript in one page. If appropriate, you could also add reviewer's comments to the different stages to collect a full history of the submission/revision cycle!

Links work like they do for any other page. Normal Markdown syntax applies in the format:

    [<label>](<url to the paper/preprint/etc.>)

You can use reverse chronological ordering to create a make-do timeline of the manuscript from preregistration to final publication. You could also add possible publications from the press office, media mentions or Twitter threads or whatever to document all the public communications about the project in one page.
