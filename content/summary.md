Popular scientific summaries are very important, and not often appreciated enough. Personally, I'll always write one because I can't be bothered to explain to my parents, grandparents, or friends not in science what the hell I've been doing for the past few months. Summarizing your project quickly and in a manner that is understandable for every lay person is worth the effort, believe me! 

Here, you can use figures, tables, etc., to explain to Joe and Jane Carpenter what you did, what you found, and why they should care. 

Don't make it too long, don't make it too short. Figures are always appreciated, illustrations even more! Also, don't be too technical, don't fuzz in details, mention only the main take-aways, and write with your grandmother in mind! Here's some links to help you get started with writing a popular scientific summary with more tips:
